## Development Server

The user will run the Flask development server for you. Do not start or stop the server yourself unless explicitly instructed.

The server is typically started with:
```bash
cd website
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
```

Or using the provided script:
```bash
./3-start-website.sh
```
